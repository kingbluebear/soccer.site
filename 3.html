    <p>Manchester City Football Club is a football club based in Manchester, England, and is the top league in English football. Founded as a cathedral in 1880, it became the West Gorton, the Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887, and Manchester City in 1894. The club's home stadium is the City of Manchester Stadium in eastern Manchester, and has been active on the Main Road since 1923. The club adopted the Sky Blue home shirt in 1894 in the first season of the club's current iteration, which has since been used.[4]

Manchester City entered the football league in 1899, and won its first major championship in the 1904 FA Cup. The club had its first major success in the late 1960s, winning the League, European Cup Winners Cup, FA Cup and League Cup under the supervision of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the FA Cup final in 1981, the club went through a period of decline, culminating in being relegated to the third division of English football for the first time in history in 1998. In the 2001-02 season, they were promoted back to the top and remain regular players in the Premier League from the 2002-03 season.
